Real-World Asset Tokenization Powered by the OREX Utility Token
Version: 1.0
Release Year: 2026
Network: BNB Smart Chain (BEP-20)
 
1. Abstract
Edenorex is a decentralized real-world asset (RWA) tokenization ecosystem designed to bridge tangible economic value with blockchain infrastructure. The platform introduces structured non-fungible token (NFT) representations of real-world asset categories and a fixed-supply utility token, OREX (ORX), to enable governance participation, staking, ecosystem incentives, and long-term community alignment.
By combining transparent tokenomics, locked liquidity, and vesting-based emissions, Edenorex aims to establish a sustainable framework that prioritizes long-term value creation, operational transparency, and responsible decentralization over short-term speculation.
 
2. Problem Statement
Traditional real-world assets such as land, infrastructure, commodities, and strategic properties face persistent limitations:
•	Low liquidity
•	High capital barriers
•	Fragmented ownership systems
•	Manual and paper-based processes
•	Limited global accessibility
•	Inefficient value transfer mechanisms
At the same time, many blockchain ecosystems focus on purely speculative digital assets that lack underlying economic relevance or long-term sustainability.
This disconnect between real-world value and digital markets creates inefficiencies, limits participation, and reduces trust.
Edenorex addresses this gap by introducing a blockchain-native framework that enables structured access to real-world asset categories while maintaining transparent economics, predictable token behavior, and decentralized participation.
 
3. Edenorex Solution Overview
Edenorex is built on three foundational pillars:
3.1 Real-World Asset Category NFTs
Edenorex NFTs represent defined categories of real-world assets rather than individual properties. This abstraction enables scalability while maintaining real-world relevance.
Asset categories may include:
•	Agricultural and land-based assets
•	Industrial and logistics infrastructure
•	Natural resource zones
•	Strategic and innovation-focused properties
NFTs are designed for ecosystem utility, access rights, and participation rather than legal ownership of specific assets.
 
3.2 Fixed-Supply Utility Token (OREX)
OREX serves as the economic backbone of the Edenorex ecosystem, enabling:
•	Staking participation
•	Governance voting
•	Ecosystem incentives
•	Access to premium NFT utilities
OREX follows a strict fixed-supply model with minting permanently disabled, ensuring predictable issuance and controlled distribution.
 
3.3 Transparency & Sustainability
Edenorex emphasizes long-term sustainability through:
•	Locked token supply
•	Locked liquidity pools
•	Vesting-based emissions
•	Public smart contract verification
•	Clear tokenomics disclosure
These mechanisms are designed to protect participants and support ecosystem longevity.
 
4. Blockchain Infrastructure & Network Selection
4.1 Why BNB Smart Chain
Edenorex is deployed on BNB Smart Chain (BEP-20) after evaluating scalability, cost efficiency, ecosystem maturity, and exchange compatibility.
BNB Smart Chain provides a production-ready environment that aligns with Edenorex’s requirements for real-world asset tokenization.
 
4.2 Key Advantages of BNB Smart Chain
Low Transaction Costs
Enables affordable NFT minting, staking participation, and ecosystem interaction.
High Throughput & Fast Finality
Supports smooth operation of marketplaces, staking modules, and governance tools.
EVM Compatibility
Allows use of audited Solidity contracts and compatibility with widely adopted wallets and tooling.
Exchange & Infrastructure Support
Widely supported by centralized exchanges, analytics platforms, and liquidity providers.
 
4.3 Security Considerations
Edenorex leverages BNB Smart Chain’s mature validator infrastructure alongside:
•	Fixed-supply token design
•	Public contract verification
•	Locked liquidity and vesting mechanisms
 
4.4 Future Network Strategy
While initially deployed on BNB Smart Chain, Edenorex remains architecturally chain-agnostic.
Future cross-chain or Layer-2 integrations may be explored through governance decisions.
 
5. OREX (ORX) Token Overview
Attribute	Detail
Token Name	OREX
Symbol	ORX
Network	BNB Smart Chain (BEP-20)
Total Supply	50,000,000 ORX
Minting	Permanently disabled
Initial Price	$0.01
DEX Pair	ORX / USDT
Liquidity	100% locked
Locked Supply	70% (PinkSale-verified)
OREX is a utility and governance token designed for ecosystem participation rather than inflationary speculation.
 
6. Token Utility
6.1 Staking
OREX holders may stake tokens to:
•	Earn protocol rewards
•	Support network stability
•	Gain priority ecosystem access
 
6.2 Governance (DAO Phase)
OREX enables participation in:
•	Protocol upgrades
•	Ecosystem parameters
•	Grant and incentive allocation
•	Partnership approvals
 
6.3 NFT Ecosystem Access
OREX is required for:
•	Premium NFT minting
•	Marketplace participation
•	NFT-based utility integrations
 
6.4 Ecosystem Incentives
Used for:
•	Community rewards
•	Contributor incentives
•	Long-term ecosystem growth programs
 
7. Tokenomics
7.1 Supply Allocation
Category	Percentage	Tokens
Locked Supply	70%	35,000,000
Circulating / Ecosystem Use	30%	15,000,000
Total	100%	50,000,000
Locked supply is secured via PinkSale-verified vesting contracts.
 
7.2 Vesting & Emission Policy
•	No sudden unlocks
•	Time-based vesting schedules
•	Predictable emission curves
•	Publicly verifiable locks
This structure minimizes sell pressure and protects long-term participants.
 
8. Liquidity Design
•	Initial liquidity pair: ORX / USDT
•	100% of LP tokens locked
•	Controlled liquidity additions over time
•	No liquidity removal risk
This design supports:
•	Stable trading conditions
•	Protection against manipulation
•	Exchange-friendly liquidity structure
 
9. Security & Transparency
Edenorex follows a security-first approach:
•	Fixed supply (no mint function)
•	Public smart contract verification
•	Locked token supply via PinkSale
•	Locked liquidity pool tokens
•	Clearly disclosed tokenomics
•	No hidden administrative minting
These measures align with audit and exchange listing requirements.
